# BARF-NerfStudio
An unofficial implementation of various BARF algorithms with nerfstudio. This repository includes the following implementations:

1. barf-freq: An implementation of [Vanilla BARF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06405)
2. barf-hash: A modification of the Vanilla BARF method to work with instant-NGP hash grid
3. barf-grad: Gradient scaled hash grid BARF from the paper [Robust Camera Pose Refinement for Multi-Resolution Hash Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01571)

If there ever pops up a new BARF style algorithm, contributions are welcome ðŸ˜ƒ

# Installation 
Ensure that nerfstudio has been installed according to the [instructions](https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html). Clone the repo and run the following commands:
``` 
conda activate nerfstudio
cd BARF-nerfstudio/
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
ns-install-cli
```

# Running BARF methods
```
ns-train barf-freq --data [DATA]
ns-train barf-hash --data [DATA]
ns-train barf-grad --data [DATA]
```

# Issues

* Currently, the directory to which the visualizations of camera poses are saved are set using a parameter `poses_dir` in `PosesConfig` in `barf_pipeline.py`. It is hardcoded to be `/path/to/cwd/poses`, but the camera pose visualizations would be stored in `poses_dir` unique to each experiment's `base_dir` (set in `trainer.py`). For a _hacky_ temporary solution for this add the following line to `setup()` in `trainer.py`
```
    def setup(self, test_mode: Literal["test", "val", "inference"] = "val") -> None:
        """Setup the Trainer by calling other setup functions.

        Args:
            test_mode:
                'val': loads train/val datasets into memory
                'test': loads train/test datasets into memory
                'inference': does not load any dataset into memory
        """
        self.pipeline = self.config.pipeline.setup(
            device=self.device,
            test_mode=test_mode,
            world_size=self.world_size,
            local_rank=self.local_rank,
            grad_scaler=self.grad_scaler,
        )

        # **INSERT THIS CODE**
        pipeline_name = str(self.pipeline)[:str(self.pipeline).find("(")]
        if (pipeline_name == "BARFPipeline"):
            self.pipeline.config.vis_config.poses_dir = str(self.base_dir / "poses")
        # **UP TO HERE**

        self.optimizers = self.setup_optimizers()
        ...
